# Sorting-Algos

## Introduction
The repository contains implementation of various sorting algorithms. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other
algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Often sorting is used as an pre-processing to various solutions.

## Description
The repo contains implementation for below sorting algorithms:

** Comparision Sorting Algos ** : A comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation 
(often a "less than or equal to" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list. The Time complexity 
that can be best achived is **O(n log n)** .<br>

The algorithms implemented are:-
- Insertion Sort : worst case time complexity O(n^2)
- Merge Sort : worst case time complexity O(nLog n)
- Heap Sort : worst case time complexity O(nLog n)
- Quick Sort : average case time complexity O(nLog n)

** Non Comparision Sorting Algos ** : A non-comparison sort algorithm uses the internal character of the values to be sorted. It can only be applied to some particular cases,
and requires particular values. And the best complexity is probably better depending on cases, such as O(n).
- Counting Sort : worst case time complexity O(n+r) where r stands for range
- Radix Sort: average case time complexity O(n)
